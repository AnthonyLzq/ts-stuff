// To distinguish between different types of objects, we can use a type property
// in each object that is unique to that object. This is called a
// "discriminated union".

// Here we are using the "kind" property to distinguish between the two types.
type Square = {

// We can then use a switch statement to determine which type we are dealing
// with and TypeScript will narrow the type for us.
